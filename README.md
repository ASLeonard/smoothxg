# smoothxg

## linearize and simplify variation graphs using collinear chaining and partial order alignment

Pangenome graphs built from raw sets of alignments may have complex local structures generated by common patterns of genome variation.
These nonlinearities can introduce difficulty in downstream analyses that depend on linear strucutres.
`smoothxg` uses the positional index capabilities of `xg` to find collinear chains of paths in variation graphs and rebuilds them in a purely linear way using partial order alignment.
In addition to providing a linear structure to the graph, `smoothxg` can be used to extract the consensus pangenome graph by applying the _heaviest bundle_ algorithm to each chain.

## building

smoothxg is built with cmake:

    cmake -H. -Bbuild && cmake --build build -- -j4
